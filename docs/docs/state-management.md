# State Management Explanation

For this project, **React's `useState` and `useEffect`** hooks were used for managing state and fetching data.

## Why `useState` and `useEffect`?

- `useState`: Manages state for the fetched cryptocurrency data, loading state, error state, and search query.
- `useEffect`: Handles side effects like data fetching when the component mounts or when the "Refresh" button is pressed.

This approach was chosen to keep the solution simple and lightweight without the need for external state management libraries like React Query.
